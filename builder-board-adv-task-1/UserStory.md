# Decentralize Project Leaderboard
**Project Name:** BuilderBoard

**Value Proposition:**

Our platform allows anyone to post their project on-chain and receive upvotes from the community. We use Solana blockchain to keep the projects on-chain ensuring transparent, tamperproof visibility of it. Builders who post their project gain exposure and users discover new trending projects in a verifiable way.

**Product-Market Fit:**

At the moment most of the project sharing platforms are centralized, That means votes, visibility can be modified from company side or lost if platform shuts down.
Our platform addressed these issues by offering an on-chain leaderboard that allows every upvote to be public, verifiable and immutable. It creates a sense of trust by making everything transparent and creates a healthy environment for indie developers and  opensource contributors to gain recognition from the community directly.

**Target User Profiles:**

- Indie Builder: This persona wants to showcase their personal projects to the public. They value genuine upvotes, feedback on the project and permanent project visibility.
- Tech Community Manager: Manages tech communities and interested in highlighting new and quality opensource tools. Values trustless project validation.
